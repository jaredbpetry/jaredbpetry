### Hey I'm Jared Petry :) ðŸ‘‹

#### What I like 

I love studying the ocean and weather patterns that make the ocean get fun for surfing! I am a certified surf nerd who would definitely be keen on chatting with you about salty happenings. 

Playing music is a big part of my life as well.  I have been playing guiter most my life and I have taken on some really random instruments as well such as the banjo, mouthharp, and spoons to name a couple.  


#### What I'm doing 

I am getting a masters degree in environmental data science right now at the Bren School of Environemntal Science and Management at UCSB.  I am particularly interested in building RShiny apps and machine learning.  I would eventually like to build some surf forecasting tools specific to Santa Barbara. It would be great to collaborate! 


#### What I want to do in the future

Well, I'm not exactly sure yet... but I would love to apply my knowledge of data science to fisheries and aqualculture, weather and surf forecasting and geospatial anaysis in general.  Love making a good map.

Shoot me an email!
